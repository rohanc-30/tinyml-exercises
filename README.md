# tinyml-exercises
TinyML Exercises from the textbook TinyML by Pete Warden and Daniel Situyanake. The textbook assumes use of an Arduino Nano BLE Sense, ArduCam, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Lite. I make use of the same hardware, but implement software through the use of PyTorch and appropriate conversion methods (ExecuTorch/ONNX instead of TF/TFLite).
